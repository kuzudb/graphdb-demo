0,Italy,"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb.

1,Portugal,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",Avidagos,87,15.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos
2,US,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",,87,14.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,Rainstorm
3,US,"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.",Reserve Late Harvest,87,13.0,Michigan,Lake Michigan Shore,,Alexander Peartree,,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),Riesling,St. Julian
4,US,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block,87,65.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Sweet Cheeks
5,Spain,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",Ars In Vitro,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),Tempranillo-Merlot,Tandem

8,Germany,"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.",Shine,87,12.0,Rheinhessen,,,Anna Lee C. Iijima,,Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen),Gewürztraminer,Heinz Eifel

10,US,"Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot.

12,US,"Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.",,87,34.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Louis M. Martini 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini
13,Italy,"This is dominated by oak and oak-driven aromas that include roasted coffee bean, espresso, coconut and vanilla that carry over to the palate, together with plum and chocolate. Astringent, drying tannins give it a rather abrupt finish.",Rosso,87,,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Masseria Setteporte 2012 Rosso  (Etna),Nerello Mascalese,Masseria Setteporte
14,US,"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.",,87,12.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Mirassou 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),Chardonnay,Mirassou
15,Germany,"Zesty orange peels and apple notes abound in this sprightly, mineral-toned Riesling.

Iijima,,Richard Böcking 2013 Devon Riesling (Mosel),Riesling,Richard Böcking
16,Argentina,"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity.

17,Argentina,"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.",Winemaker Selection,87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Gaucho Andino 2011 Winemaker Selection Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Gaucho Andino
18,Spain,"Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino.

19,US,"Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back.

20,US,"Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco.
